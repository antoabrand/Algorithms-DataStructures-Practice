--LinkedLists
    Node - composed of data & reference/link to next/previous node in sequence

    Used to implement stacks, queues

    Requires sequential scanning for locating data within structure - no indices

    ...Pros: dynamic, allocates needed memory in run-time,
        very efficient if we want to manipulate the first Elements,
        stores items with different size
    ...Cons: wastes memory bc of references, nodes must be read from the beginning 
        as they have sequential access, itesm reached in O(1) - linear complexity,
        reverse traversing is difficult - Solution: doubly linked lists -> easier to read, 
        but memory is wasted in allocating space for a back pointer 

    Insertion of items - simple, update references

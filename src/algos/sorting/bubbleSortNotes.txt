BubbleSort Notes

        As algorithm progresses, will partition into a sorted partition
    and an unsorted partition, using the same array that we are sorting logically.

        We compare each element with it's neighboring element from left to right.  If left
    element is smaller we leave it as is, otherwise we swap them out using a temporary
    index to hold the an element.

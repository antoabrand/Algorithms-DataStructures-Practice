Similar to BubbleSort and SelectionSort in that sorting groups the collection into 2 
separate groups, one sorted and one unsorted.  This time we are iterating from L -> R

firstUnsortedIndex = 1 

i=0 - used to traverse the sorted partition from R -> L 

newElement - the value we want to insert into the sorted partition

- inPlace algorithm - does not take up additional memory  

- stable algorithm 

This algorithm does not take swap method, instead uses shifting in order to move 
elements into their correctly sorted spots.

Assumes element in position zero is in the correct position
